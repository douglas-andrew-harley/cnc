; This program was created by Jeff Simpson 08/10/2019
;
; This G-code probes the center of my copper X0Y0 corner fixture. 
; When this program is invoked the tool will be off the center of the 
; probe fixture, hence the program has two cycles. 
;
; The 1st pass starts out off center and runs at a faster speed.
; The 2nd pass starts from the 1st pass discovered center location
; and runs at a slower speed. True tangents and and slower feed rates
; are always more accurate, plus it's automated so who cares.

#<_delta-FR1> = 10.0 ; feedrate for 1st pass, set to a feedrate that works for you and you machine.
#<_delta-FR2> = 5.0 ; feedrate for 2nd pass, again set it to what works for you.
