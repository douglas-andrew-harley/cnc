# FCCH CNC files

This repo contains archives of information related to the various CNC machines
at the Creator Hub. Each machine's data is in a separate top-level directory.
Within each directory, there are various sub-directories for hardware design,
software config files, etc.

## Wood-48x48

CNC Router in wood shop.

## Metal_mill

Donated 3-axis mill previously retrofitted for CNC.  The controller was old and did not work with LinuxCNC and it also was just mounted on a plate and not enclosed so we built a new controller modelled after the Wood-48x48 controller.  This folder contains the design and documentation for that new controller cabinet.
